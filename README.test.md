The following is a `cli-help` block itself generated using `readme-cli-help`:

````cli-help-test

  --readme-path OUTPUT        Path to the README file."
  --fence STRING              Markdown code fence identifier (the part after the first ````).
  --allow-exit-code INTEGER   Do not error if the help command returns with the specified exit code. Note: an exit code code of 0 is treated as a success even if this flag is passed.
  --check-only                Check that the existing README contents match what is generated using the help command (without modifying them).
